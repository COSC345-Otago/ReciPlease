# COSC345---ReciPlease

[*Documentation*](https://github.com/timcop/ReciPlease/wiki)

COSC 345 - Software engineering, app creation project.

Generate and choose from recipes based on your budget and number of people you are cooking for.

## How to run

Clone the repository, open the ReciPlease-Beta project in XCode and build.
We developed ReciPlease for the iPhone 11 Pro Max, but our app works on any iPhone.

## What we learnt from our Beta
Our beta had a lot of issues, app crashes, bad memory management, faulty api calls etc. We saw to it to completely redesign the application and start from scratch. We changed how we approached our API call first, this is now down by making an api call with a specific string to search for, rather than previously downloading all the products ahead of time. We completely redesigned the UI of the app, where the home screen features recipes in "recipe card" format which is a horizontal list, which upon clicking on will take you to a detail view of the recipe. We kept the random button as we saw this an essential component for the "time-wasting" theme of the app.
